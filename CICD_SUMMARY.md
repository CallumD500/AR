# üéì CI/CD Summary - What You've Learned

## Overview

You now have a **complete, production-ready CI/CD pipeline** that automatically deploys your WebAR experience to GitHub Pages. This document summarizes everything you have and how to use it.

---

## üéØ What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD = Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment**

### Traditional Way (Manual):
```
1. Write code
2. Test locally
3. Build manually
4. Upload to server via FTP
5. Hope nothing breaks
6. Repeat for every change
```
‚ùå **Time:** 30+ minutes per deployment  
‚ùå **Error-prone:** Manual steps can be forgotten  
‚ùå **Stressful:** What if something breaks in production?

### Your New Way (Automated CI/CD):
```
1. Write code
2. git push
3. ‚òï Grab coffee
4. ‚úÖ It's live!
```
‚úÖ **Time:** ~2 minutes  
‚úÖ **Reliable:** Same process every time  
‚úÖ **Stress-free:** Automated testing and deployment

## üì¶ What You Have

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
This file tells GitHub what to do when you push code:

```yaml
On push to main:
  1. Checkout your code
  2. Setup Node.js 20
  3. Install dependencies (npm ci)
  4. Build production app (npm run build)
  5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
  6. Done! Site is live
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic on every push
- Can be manually triggered
- Caches dependencies for speed
- Proper GitHub Pages permissions
- Concurrent deployment protection

### 2. **Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.github.js`)
Special build configuration for GitHub Pages:

```javascript
- Correct base path: /repo-name/
- Optimized asset handling
- GLB file management
- Production optimizations
```

### 3. **Setup Script** (`setup-github.sh`)
Automated setup script that:
- Prompts for GitHub username and repo name
- Configures Vite with correct settings
- Initializes Git repository
- Creates first commit
- Pushes to GitHub
- Provides next steps

### 4. **NPM Scripts** (`package.json`)
New commands available:

```bash
npm run build:github   # Build for GitHub Pages
npm run deploy:github  # Manual deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### 5. **Documentation**
Complete guides:
- `GITHUB_CICD_GUIDE.md` - Full tutorial
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - All deployment options
- This file - Summary of CI/CD

---

## üöÄ How to Use It

### Quick Start (Easiest)

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./setup-github.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# - Enter your GitHub username
# - Enter your repository name
# - Confirm
# - Done!
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Create repo on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/new

# 2. Set your repo name
export VITE_REPO_NAME="your-repo-name"

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Initialize Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: WebAR with CI/CD"
git branch -M main

# 5. Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
git push -u origin main

# 6. Enable GitHub Pages
# Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: "GitHub Actions"

# 7. Wait ~2 minutes
# Go to Actions tab to watch deployment
```

---

## üîÑ Your Daily Workflow

### Making Changes

```bash
# 1. Edit your code
code index.html

# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update AR experience"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push

# 5. Automatic deployment starts!
# Watch: https://github.com/USER/REPO/actions

# 6. ~2 minutes later: LIVE!
# Visit: https://USER.github.io/REPO/
```

### Monitoring Deployments

```bash
# View all deployments
open https://github.com/USER/REPO/actions

# Each deployment shows:
- Timestamp
- Commit message  
- Duration
- Status (‚úì success or ‚úó failed)
- Full logs
```

## üéì Understanding the Pipeline

### The Build Job

```yaml
build:
  Steps:
    1. Checkout code from GitHub
    2. Setup Node.js 20 with npm cache
    3. Run: npm ci (clean install)
    4. Run: npm run build
    5. Upload dist/ folder as artifact
```

**What happens:**
- Gets your code from GitHub
- Installs exact dependencies from package-lock.json
- Builds production-optimized app
- Prepares files for deployment

### The Deploy Job

```yaml
deploy:
  Depends on: build (waits for build to finish)
  Steps:
    1. Download build artifact (dist/ folder)
    2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
    3. Site goes live!
```

**What happens:**
- Takes the built files
- Uploads to GitHub Pages CDN
- Your site is live worldwide!

### Why Two Jobs?

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Build = Create production files
   - Deploy = Make them live

2. **Reusability:**
   - Can deploy same build to multiple places
   - Can test build before deploying

3. **Speed:**
   - Jobs can run in parallel when needed
   - Artifacts cached between jobs

---

## üìä Key Concepts

### 1. **GitHub Actions**
- Free CI/CD platform by GitHub
- Runs on GitHub's servers
- YAML-based configuration
- Triggered by events (push, PR, schedule)

**Free Tier:**
- Public repos: Unlimited minutes ‚úÖ
- Private repos: 2000 minutes/month

### 2. **GitHub Pages**
- Free static site hosting
- Automatic HTTPS (required for WebAR!)
- Fast global CDN
- Perfect for frontend apps

**URL Format:**
- User site: `https://username.github.io/`
- Project site: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

### 3. **Workflows**
- Defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Multiple workflows per repo
- Triggered by events
- Made of jobs ‚Üí steps ‚Üí actions

**Example Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:              # On every push
  pull_request:      # On PR
  schedule:          # Cron schedule
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger
```

### 4. **Artifacts**
- Files passed between jobs
- Survives job completion
- Stored temporarily by GitHub
- Used for deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Change Deployment Branch

```yaml
# In deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main      # Deploy from main
      - develop   # Also deploy from develop
```

### Add Testing

```yaml
# In deploy.yml, before build
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test

- name: Build with Vite
  run: npm run build
```

### Deploy to Staging First

```yaml
# Create deploy-staging.yml
on:
  pull_request:     # Deploy PRs to staging
  
deploy:
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
```

### Add Notifications

```yaml
- name: Notify on Discord
  if: success()
  uses: sarisia/actions-status-discord@v1
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Workflow doesn't run

**Checks:**
- [ ] Pushed to `main` or `master` branch?
- [ ] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists?
- [ ] Actions enabled in Settings ‚Üí Actions?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify branch
git branch --show-current

# Force trigger
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push
```

### Problem: Build fails

**Checks:**
- [ ] Does `npm run build` work locally?
- [ ] Are all files committed?
- [ ] Is `package.json` correct?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test locally first
npm ci
npm run build

# Check logs in Actions tab
# Fix errors and push again
```

### Problem: Site shows 404

**Checks:**
- [ ] Deployment succeeded in Actions?
- [ ] Pages enabled in Settings?
- [ ] Correct repo name in config?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check repo name in vite.config.github.js
# Should match your GitHub repo name

# Or set environment variable
export VITE_REPO_NAME="correct-repo-name"

# Rebuild and push
npm run build:github
git add dist/
git commit -m "Fix repo name"
git push
```

### Problem: Assets not loading

**Cause:** Incorrect asset paths

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- Use absolute paths -->
<a-asset-item src="/model.glb"></a-asset-item>

<!-- Not relative paths -->
<a-asset-item src="./model.glb"></a-asset-item>
```

## üìà Best Practices

### 1. **Test Before Pushing**
```bash
# Always test locally first
npm run dev         # Test in dev
npm run build       # Test build works
npm run preview     # Test production build
```

### 2. **Meaningful Commit Messages**
```bash
# Good ‚úì
git commit -m "Add scale animation to 3D model"
git commit -m "Fix marker detection on iOS"

# Bad ‚úó
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
```

### 3. **Small, Frequent Commits**
```bash
# Good ‚úì
- Commit each feature separately
- Easy to find bugs
- Clear history

# Bad ‚úó
- One huge commit with everything
- Hard to debug
- Messy history
```

### 4. **Use Branches for Features**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-marker

# Work on feature
# Test thoroughly

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-marker
git push  # Auto-deploys!
```

### 5. **Monitor Deployments**
- Check Actions tab after pushing
- Verify site loads correctly
- Test on mobile device
- Check for console errors
